# optimization-of-water-adduction-mains-path

The efficient design of water adduction main involves several 
optimization processes among which an important place is held by 
their path optimization. In this project, we developed two 
deterministic mathematical models for optimization of water 
adduction main path. Using these optimization models could be 
obtained an optimal solution for selection of source location and of 
water adduction main path based on graph theory and dynamic 
programming.

This paper develops two deterministic mathematical models for 
optimization of water adduction main path, based on techniques of 
sequential operational calculus, implemented in a computer program. 
Using these optimization models could be obtained an optimal
solution for selection of source location and of water adduction main 
path based on graph theory and dynamic programming. The results 
of few numerical applications show the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the proposed optimization models.
